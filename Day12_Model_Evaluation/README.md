# Day 12 – Model Evaluation

## 📌 Objective
Evaluate the trained machine learning model using unseen test data and measure its performance using standard regression metrics.

---

## 🧠 Overview
In this stage, the Linear Regression model trained on **Day 9** is loaded and evaluated.  
The goal is to validate model performance and ensure it generalizes well to new data.

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
- Loaded the processed dataset from Day 8  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Loaded the trained model (`model.pkl`)  
- Generated predictions on test data  
- Evaluated the model using regression metrics

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures average squared prediction error  
- **R² Score:** Indicates how much variance in the target is explained by the model
